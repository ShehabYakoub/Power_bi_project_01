The project had two primary objectives:
- Monitoring essential HR metrics related to employees.
- Gaining insights into the factors influencing attrition within the company.

Upon completion, I developed an interactive dashboard that not only met these objectives but also provided additional valuable insights. One of these insights is that people who worked there for only 1 year have the highest attrition rate (34.5%).
